# feedback-manager-frontend for Fujitsu Summer Internship 2021.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your device and is added to your environment variable.

## Running the project
1. Download/Clone the project.
2. Open it in your preferred IDE. I would recommend IntelliJ. But you can run the project from command line as well.
3. Open IntelliJ's own terminal and make sure your directory is "feedback-manager-frontend". If you're running the project from the command line, same goes here - switch into the project directory. Then you should also do the following
- Run `npm install`in your project directory. It should add all the node modules needed.
- Add Angular CLI to the project, by running following command `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Run `npm run ng build`
- Run `ng serve` 
4. Front-end should now be accessible on your browser on localhost:4200

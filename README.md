# feedback-manager-frontend for Fujitsu Summer Internship 2021.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your device.

## Running the project
1. Download/Clone the project.
2. Open it in your preferred IDE. I would recommend IntelliJ. But you can run the project from command line as well.
3. Open IntelliJ's own terminal and make sure your directory is "feedback-manager-frontend". If you're running the project from the command line, same goes here - switch into the project directory. If you're in the project directory, then write `ng serve` command. 
4. Frontend should be accessible on your browser on localhost:4200
